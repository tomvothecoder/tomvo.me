                When I was fourteen my brother introduced me to exercise as
                summertime hobby. I admit, logging off of Maplestory took some
                convincing. I went from slaying monsters to slaying weights.

                  Physical training has been an integral part of my life for
                  over a decade.

                  Throughtout the years I dedicated hundreds of hours researching exercise

                I coached friends and family members in their own exercise
                journeys, which ranged from general health and fitness to
                powerlifting. I find immense joy in helping people develop tangible
                goals and achieving them one step at a time.{" "}

                I am driven to learn, ask questions, and share my knowledge with
                others. Whether you're new to exercise or have prior experience,
                I would love to learn about your aspirations in exercise. Enough
