                When I was fourteen years old, my brother introduced me to home
                workouts as a summertime hobby. I admit, logging off of
                Maplestory to lift took some convincing. From slaying bosses to
                slaying weights,
                <b> physical training became an integral part of my life.</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>
                  Over the years, I invested hundreds of hours researching
                  exercise science, kinesiology, and program development.{" "}
                </b>
                I coached friends and family members in their own exercise
                journeys, refining my skills in the process. I am driven to
                learn, ask questions, and share my knowledge with others.{" "}
                <b>
                  It is an absolute joy helping people develop tangible goals
                  and witnessing them incrementally achieve their milestones.{" "}

                Whether you're new to exercise or have prior experience, I would
                love to learn about your aspirations in exercise. Enough said,
                let's make some gains together! ðŸ’ªðŸ™Œ
