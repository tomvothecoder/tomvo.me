                When I was fourteen years old, my brother introduced me to
                resistance training as a summertime hobby. I was initially
                "resistant" to the idea of getting off Maplestory to lift, but I
                finally came around. From slaying bosses to slaying weights,
                <b> training became an integral part of my life.</b>

                Over the years, I invested hundreds of hours researching
                exercise science and kinesiology. I coached friends and family
                members in their own exercise journeys, refining my knowledge in
                the process.{" "}
